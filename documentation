How to Create an IAM Role with Administrator Access (and Add Specific Users)
Follow these steps to set up an IAM role in AWS with full admin permissions, while allowing only specific users to assume it.
## 1. Log into AWS
Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in using an account with IAM privileges.
---
## 2. Open the IAM Dashboard
In the search bar at the top, type **IAM** and select it to open the Identity and Access Management dashboard.
---
## 3. Create a New Role
1. Click **Roles** in the left sidebar.
2. Hit **Create role**.
3. For **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS account**.
4. Select **This account** if you’re keeping it within your own AWS account or selcet **Another AWS account**
---
## 4. Attach Permissions
1. On the permissions page, search for **AdministratorAccess**.
2. Select it — this policy gives full access to all AWS services and resources.
3. Click **Next**.
---
## 5. Name Your Role
Give your role a clear name, such as `AdminAccessRole` or `FullAdminRole`.
Optionally, add a short description like “Full admin access for selected users.”
Click **Create role** when you’re ready.
---
## 6. Add Specific Users in the Trust Policy
If you want to limit which users can assume this role, edit its trust policy:
1. Go to **IAM → Roles → [Your Role Name] → Trust relationships**.
2. Click **Edit trust policy**.
3. Paste and modify the following JSON:
   
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": [
             "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice",
             "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob",
             "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Charlie"
           ]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Replace the account ID (`123456789012`) and user names (`Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`) with your actual ones.
4. Click **Update policy** to save your changes.
---
## 7. Verify Everything
Double-check:
* **Permissions** tab → shows `AdministratorAccess` policy attached.
* **Trust relationships** tab → lists your allowed users correctly.
---
## 8. Test the Role
Try switching to the new role from one of the allowed user accounts:
1. In the AWS console, click your username (top-right).
2. Choose **Switch role**.
3. Enter your **Account ID** and **Role name**.
4. If everything’s set up right, you’ll have full admin access under that role.
